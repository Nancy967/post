# post

This is a website created using React and Spring Boot, named "Post." It consists of three main pages:

"Home Page": This page is primarily for businesses, such as restaurants, to provide a brief introduction to their business information.

"Posts Page": This page allows businesses to publish their latest updates. At the top, there are two links: "All Posts" to display posts in order of their most recent changes and a pagination feature at the bottom. The other link is "New Post" to create a new post, which automatically redirects to the "All Posts" section. Clicking on an individual post takes you to the "Post Detail" page, where you can find a "Go Back" button to return to the previous page. At the bottom of this page, there are "Edit" and "Delete" buttons for modifying or removing posts.

Future Expansion Directions:
* All Posts: Add two buttons, "Latest Releases" and "Recent Updates," as well as a search field.
* Pagination: Change from listing all pages to displaying only the first and last three pages, with "..." replacing the rest.
* Post Detail: Implement permission verification for the Edit and Delete functions, allowing only administrators to use them.
* New Post: Implement permission verification, allowing only administrators to use this feature.
* Newsletter: Enhance its backend functionality.
